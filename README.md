What does PDM stand for?

## What is this?

This repo is a collection of serious or silly full names of PDM that will randomly appear in the header of https://pdm-project.org

## How to contribute?

1. Add your own full names to [expansions.txt](/expansions.txt) or [expansions-zh.txt](/expansions-zh.txt) for Chinese, and sort them in alphabetic order (now run `sorting.py` to automatically sort them, but it needs `pypinyin` library for Chinese sorting).
2. Send us a pull request.

Your suggestion must not violate the [PSF code of conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/).
